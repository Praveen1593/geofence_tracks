## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Add a Geofence**
    - Open the app and navigate to the **Add Geofence** screen.
    - Enter a title, select a location, and set the radius.
    - Tap **Save Geofence**.

2. **Verify Entry & Exit Notifications**
    - Move into the geofenced area → Expect a notification and alert.
    - Move out of the geofenced area → Expect another notification.

3. **Check Movement History**
    - Navigate to the **Movement History** screen.
    - Verify that each movement entry (inside/outside) is logged with a timestamp.

4. **Test Background Location Tracking**
    - Close the app and move around (ensure background location is enabled).
    - Reopen the app and check movement history for updates.

## 📌 Notes
- Ensure location services and permissions are enabled on your device.
- For background tracking, enable **Auto-start** in device settings (for Android).
- Location updates might be delayed due to device power optimizations.
